      <p>
        Announced during NYC Climate Week in September 2022 and led by Her Highness Sheikha Shamma bint Sultan bin Khalifa Al Nahyan, UAE Independent Climate Change Accelerators (UICCA) was created as an independent global entity to accelerate climate action across three priorities: circular economy, carbon solutions, and climate adaptation.
      </p>
      <p>UICCA programmes and initiatives are designed to drive the UAE’s transition to a green economy through effective innovation, collaboration, and policy advocacy in support of the UAE Net Zero by 2050 strategic initiative. Our work focusses on fostering strategic partnerships, driving innovation, and providing expert advice to inform and advance climate action through research, policy, and capacity building. Through this collaborative framework, UICCA bridges gaps between sectors, aligns goals, and significantly drives collective impact on the global climate action agenda.
